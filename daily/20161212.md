####git usage

$ git config --list

Shows information about current repository.

Three ways to untrack changes of files:
* Creating a local .gitignore file
 1. In Terminal, navigate to the location of your Git repository.
 2. Enter _touch .gitignore_ to create a .gitignore file.  
 If you already have a file checked in, and you want to ignore it, Git will not ignore the file if you add a rule later. In those cases, you must untrack the file first, by running the following command in your terminal:  
 ```shell
 git rm --cached FILENAME
 ```
* Creating a global .gitignore
 1. Open Terminal.
 2. Run the following command in your terminal:  
 ```shell
 git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
 ```
* Explicit repository excludes
 1. In Terminal, navigate to the location of your Git repository.
 2. Using your favorite text editor, open the file .git/info/exclude.
