### New Things This Month

#### Git Usages
------
* Shows information about current repository.
    ```
    $ git config --list
    ```

* Print all your remotes' fetch/push URLs.[link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4089430/how-can-i-determine-the-url-that-a-local-git-repository-was-originally-cloned-fr)
    ```
    $ git remote -v
    ```

* Create a git repository in the remote server.[link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6648995/how-to-create-a-remote-git-repository-from-a-local-one)
    ```
    $ git clone --bare my_project my_project.git
    $ scp -r my_project.git user@git.example.com:/opt/git
    ```
    Now other user who have ssh access to the same server which has read-access to */opt/git* directory can clone your repository by running
    ```
    $ git clone user@git.example.com:/opt/git/my_project.git
    ```

* Three ways to untrack changes of files.[link](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files/)
    1. Creating a local .gitignore file
        1. In Terminal, navigate to the location of your Git repository.
        2. Enter _touch .gitignore_ to create a .gitignore file.
            If you already have a file checked in, and you want to ignore it, Git will not ignore the file if you add a rule later. In those cases, you must untrack the file first, by running the following command in your terminal:
            ```shell
            $ git rm --cached FILENAME
            ```
    2. Creating a global .gitignore
        ```
        $ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
        ```
    3. Explicit repository excludes
        Edit the file .git/info/exclude.

* Compare the current file with the most recent commit.
    ```shell
    $ git diff myfile.txt            # Not added yet
    $ git diff --cached myfile.txt   # Already added
    ```

* Git global configuration
    *~/.gitconfig* is the global configuration file for git. Global variables like email and name will be stored in it. You can also add alias for git commands in it.

    ```
    [alias]
    co = checkout
    br = branch
    st = status
    ```
    and so on.

    M  # move cursor to the middle of the window
    L  # move cursor to the bottom of the window
    I  # move to the beginning of the line and switch to insert mode
    ```

* redo Ctrl R

* Vundle.[link](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)  
    Vundle is short for Vim bundle and is a Vim plugin manager.
    Just clone the repository into specify location using git
    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
    ```
    and paste the configure file on top of .vimrc file.  
    Then you can launch vim and run *:PluginInstall* to install plugins.

* My .vimrc settings
    ```
    Plugin 'jiangmiao/auto-pairs'

    set number  
    set tabstop=4  
    set shiftwidth=4  
    set softtabstop=4  
    ```

#### Linux
------
* All ports are listed in /etc/services
* Program indication
    ```shell
    #!/bin/bash
    ```
    This is a special clue given to the shell indicating what program is used to interpret the script. In this case, it is /bin/bash. Other scripting languages such as perl, awk, tcl, Tk, and python can also use this mechanism.

* Cron job.[link](http://www.computerhope.com/unix/ucrontab.htm)
    ```
    $crontab -e
    ```
    Open and edit crontable file to make cron jobs.

    To define the time you can provide concrete values for minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon), and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any')

    For example:  
    ```
    * 10 * * * cd /home/mitchell/Desktop/weibo_weather_robot/;./send_weather_weibo.py >> ./log 2>&1
    ```
    creates a cron job to be execute every day at 10a.m.

    **crontab options:**

    -l Display the current crontab.  
    -r Remove the current crontab.  
    -e Edit the current crontab.

    Notice that first parameter * means every minute.

* Tail options.[link](https://www.linode.com/docs/tools-reference/tools/view-and-follow-the-end-of-text-files-with-tail)  
    *-n number* specify how many lines to be printed.
    *-f* follow mode. When new lines are added they are printed to the terminal.

* Check out the route table
    ```
    $ route -n
    $ netstat -rn
    ```

* Static IP address.[link1](https://www.howtoforge.com/linux-basics-set-a-static-ip-on-ubuntu)[link2](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/network-configuration.html)  
    open file */etc/network/interfaces*
    ```
    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet static
            address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx(enter your ip here)
            netmask xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
            gateway xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx(enter gateway ip here,usually the address of the router)
            dns-nameservers xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
    ```
    and then restart network
    ```
    $ sudo ifdown eth0;sudo ifup eth0
    ```

* Disable ssh user password login
    In file */etc/ssh/sshd_config*, change
    ```
    #PasswordAuthentication yes
    ```
    to
    ```
    PasswordAuthentication no
    ```
    and then restart ssh service
    ```
    $ service ssh restart
    ```

* Count lines in a file
    ```
    $ wc -l FILENAME
    ```

* CentOS check ssh login log
    ```
    $ tail -n 10 /var/log/secure
    ```
* Time Zone
    ```
    $ dpkg-reconfigure
    ```
    will enter a graphical interface to configure timezone.

* Adding a new user with sudo privilege.[link1](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-14-04) [link2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-sudo-user-on-centos-quickstart)
 
    Generally speaking is a bad habbit to use root user as a daily use user.  
    Instead, we should use a normal user with sudo privilege.
    ```
    $ gpasswd -a username sudo          # Ubuntu
    $ usermod -aG wheel username        # CentOS
    ```
* Give write access to group users.
    ```
    $ chmod -R g+w directory
    ```
* How do multiple clients connect simultaneously to one port on a server? [link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3329641/how-do-multiple-clients-connect-simultaneously-to-one-port-say-80-on-a-server)
    A socket is identified by {SRC-IP, SRC-PORT, DEST-IP, DEST-PORT, PROTOCOL};  
    * Two clients connecting to same server port means: socket1 {SRC-A, 100, DEST-X,80, TCP} and socket2{SRC-B, 100, DEST-X,80, TCP};
    * Two clients can connect to same server port because for each client we can assign a different socket (as client IP will definitely differ). Same client can also have two sockets connecting to same server port - since such sockets differ by SRC-PORT;
    * Now as long as a server knows which request is associated with which socket, it can always respond to appropriate client using the same socket. Thus a server never needs to open another port in its own node than the original one on which client initially tried to bind.
* [link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33508997/waitpid-wnohang-wuntraced-how-do-i-use-these) *waitpid()* function. When *WNOHANG* option is specified, *waitpid()* will take a look at the processes specified by the first parameter of the function, and then:
    * If any zombie state process exist, one of them will be reaped, and its pid will be returned;
    * If all processes specified are still running(not terminated, or zombie), the function will do nothing and 0 will be returned;
    * If there are no processed specified by the first parameter, -1 will be return and errno will be set to ECHILD.

* tcpdump options:
    * -i specify interface to listen on.
    * -n display addresses rather than names.
    * -w write to file.
    * -Z specify user.
    * -r read from a -w output file.

* [Here](http://www.howtogeek.com/177621/the-beginners-guide-to-iptables-the-linux-firewall/) is a good tutorial for **iptables**
    ```
    iptables -L -v
    ```
    Basic usage to check the existing policies.

    ```
    iptables --policy INPUT ACCEPT
    iptables --policy OUTPUT ACCEPT
    iptables --policy FORWARD ACCEPT
    ```
    Accept connections by default.

* screen ctrl-A :quit to terminate all sessions.
* Unix signals [Some comman singal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_signal)

    Signal|Portable number|Default Action|Description
    --- | --- | --- | ---
    SIGCHLD|n/a|Ignor|Child process terminated, stopped, or continued.
    SIGINT|2|Terminate|Terminal interrupt signal.
    SIGKILL|9|Terminate|Kill (cannot be caught or ignored).

#### Makefile
------
* Here is a very good tutorial for makefile beginners. [link](http://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/)

* Example (for recall)

    ```
    IDIR =../include
    CC=gcc
    CFLAGS=-I$(IDIR)

    ODIR=obj
    LDIR =../lib

    LIBS=-lm

    _DEPS = hellomake.h
    DEPS = $(patsubst %,$(IDIR)/%,$(_DEPS))

    _OBJ = hellomake.o hellofunc.o 
    OBJ = $(patsubst %,$(ODIR)/%,$(_OBJ))


    $(ODIR)/%.o: %.c $(DEPS)
    $(CC) -c -o $@ $< $(CFLAGS)

    hellomake: $(OBJ)
    gcc -o $@ $^ $(CFLAGS) $(LIBS)

    .PHONY: clean

    clean:
    rm -f $(ODIR)/*.o *~ core $(INCDIR)/*~ 
    ```

* [**string substitution**](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Text-Functions.html)
    ```
    $(subst from,to,text)
    ```
    Performs a textual replacement on the text text: each occurrence of from is replaced by to. The result is substituted for the function call. For example:
    ```
    $(subst ee,EE,feet on the street)
    ```
    substitutes the string ‘fEEt on the strEEt’.

    ```
    $(patsubst pattern,replacement,text)
    ```
    Find whitespace-separated words in text that match pattern and replaces them with replacement. For example:
    ```
    $(patsubst %.c,%.o,x.c.c bar.c)
    ```
    produces the value ‘x.c.o bar.o’

    And there are many short-cuts listed in the link.

* [**Automatic Variables**](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html#Automatic-Variables)
    * $@ The file name of the target of the rule.
    * $< The name of the first prerequisite.
    * $^ The names of all the prerequisites, with spaces between them.
    * $? The names of all the prerequisites that are newer than the target, with spaces between them.


#### Raspberry Pi
------
* Raspberry pi has a semi-graphical configure interface
    ```
    $ sudo raspi-config
    ```
    which can allow you to change login method(disabling gui login) and start ssh service.

* Root user
    root user in Raspberry Pi is not set by default.

    *sudo* will let you run commands with super user privileges.

    To set the root password you could write:
    ```
    sudo passwd root
    ```
    But for general running this is not needed, as you can run commands using sudo.

* [Here](https://frillip.com/using-your-raspberry-pi-3-as-a-wifi-access-point-with-hostapd/) is a good tutorial to set up a wifi hotspot using raspberry pi 3.


#### Python
------
* Print Chinese characters.[link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2688020/how-to-print-chinese-word-in-my-code-using-python)  
    First need to declare an encoding
    ```python
    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    ```
    then
    ```python
    print u'哈哈'.encode('utf-8')
    ```

* Time string format
    strftime() function series is for formatting time string.
    ```python
    >>> from datetime import datetime
    >>> datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    '2011-05-03 17:45:35.177000'

    >>> from time import gmtime, strftime
    >>> strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", gmtime())
    '2009-01-05 22:14:39'
    ```

#### Word Press Apache
------
* Install apache php wordpress on Tencent Cloud Service  
    [云服务器 云数据库 搭建wordpress博客](http://bbs.qcloud.com/thread-849-1-1.html)
    Be careful about the security setting. Make sure port 80 is open to public access.
* [Here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-wordpress-on-ubuntu-14-04) is a very good tutorial for install wordpress with apache.  
    Note: *www-data* user on Ubuntu is equivalent to *apache* user on CentOS.
    Data should be owned by *apache* if you want them to be modified by your web scripts.
* Wordpress apache ownership setup. [link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28918996/proper-owner-of-var-www-html) google searche *who should be the owner of /var/www*
    CMSs like wordpress have bad support with the ownership of the files on Linux. The most convenient way to configure is to set all file under /var/www/html to be owned (and group owned) by www-data on Ubuntu(apache on CentOS), and give write access to www-data group.


#### Others
------
* 443 is the port for https
* [thinkpage](http://www.thinkpage.cn/) is a website to fetch weather information easily.  
    Just register and send http request as asked, json format message including all kinds of information will be returned.
