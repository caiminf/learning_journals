####Raspberry Pi
root user in Raspberry Pi is not set by default.

*sudo* will let you run commands with super user privileges.

To set the root password you could write:
```
sudo passwd root
```
but for general running this is not needed, as you can run commands using sudo.

####Linux
* Count lines in a file
 ```
 $ wc -l FILENAME
 ```

* cron job
 Notice that first parameter * means every minute.
