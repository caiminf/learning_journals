###New Things Today

####Linux
* Apache users
 *www-data* user on Ubuntu is equivalent to *apache* user on CentOS.
 Data should be owned by *apache* to be able to modify them via your web scripts.

* Adding a new user with sudo privilege.[link1](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-14-04) [link2](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-sudo-user-on-centos-quickstart)
 Generally speaking is a bad habbit to use root user as a daily use user.  
 Instead, we should use a normal user with sudo privilege.
 ```
 $ gpasswd -a username sudo          # Ubuntu
 $ usermod -aG wheel username        # CentOS
 ```

* Wordpress apache ownership setup.[link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28918996/proper-owner-of-var-www-html) google searche *who should be the owner of /var/www*
 CMSs like wordpress have bad support with the ownership of the files on Linux. The most convenient way to configure is to set all file under /var/www/html to be owned (and group owned) by www-data on Ubuntu(apache on CentOS), and give write access to www-data group.

* Give write access to group users.
 ```
 $ chmod -R g+w directory
 ```

* Here is a very good tutorial for makefile beginners. [link](http://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/)

* How do multiple clients connect simultaneously to one port on a server? [link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3329641/how-do-multiple-clients-connect-simultaneously-to-one-port-say-80-on-a-server)
 A socket is identified by {SRC-IP, SRC-PORT, DEST-IP, DEST-PORT, PROTOCOL};  
 * Two clients connecting to same server port means: socket1 {SRC-A, 100, DEST-X,80, TCP} and socket2{SRC-B, 100, DEST-X,80, TCP};
 * Two clients can connect to same server port because for each client we can assign a different socket (as client IP will definitely differ). Same client can also have two sockets connecting to same server port - since such sockets differ by SRC-PORT;
 * Now as long as a server knows which request is associated with which socket, it can always respond to appropriate client using the same socket. Thus a server never needs to open another port in its own node than the original one on which client initially tried to bind.
