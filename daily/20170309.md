    man pages:  
    1. [epoll](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html)
    2. [epoll_create](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/epoll_create.2.html)
    3. [epoll_wait](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/epoll_wait.2.html)
    4. [epoll_ctl](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/epoll_ctl.2.html)

    example:

    ```C
    #define MAX_EVENTS 10
    struct epoll_event ev, events[MAX_EVENTS];
    int listen_sock, conn_sock, nfds, epollfd;

    /* Code to set up listening socket, 'listen_sock',
        (socket(), bind(), listen()) omitted */

    epollfd = epoll_create1(0);
    if (epollfd == -1) {
        perror("epoll_create1");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    ev.events = EPOLLIN;
    ev.data.fd = listen_sock;
    if (epoll_ctl(epollfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, listen_sock, &ev) == -1) {
        perror("epoll_ctl: listen_sock");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    for (;;) {
        nfds = epoll_wait(epollfd, events, MAX_EVENTS, -1);
        if (nfds == -1) {
            perror("epoll_wait");
            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
        }

        for (n = 0; n < nfds; ++n) {
            if (events[n].data.fd == listen_sock) {
                conn_sock = accept(listen_sock,
                                    (struct sockaddr *) &addr, &addrlen);
                if (conn_sock == -1) {
                    perror("accept");
                    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
                }
                setnonblocking(conn_sock);
                ev.events = EPOLLIN | EPOLLET;
                ev.data.fd = conn_sock;
                if (epoll_ctl(epollfd, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, conn_sock,
                            &ev) == -1) {
                    perror("epoll_ctl: conn_sock");
                    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
                }
            } else {
                do_use_fd(events[n].data.fd);
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    **Typical usage**: Create a epoll instance using *epoll_create(epoll_create1)*, set the *epoll_event* you want to monitor with specific event type and file descriptor, and add the events into your epoll instance using *epoll_ctl* with parameter *EPOLL_CTL_ADD*, and then *epoll_wait*. You need to have a *epoll_event* array passed to *epoll_wait* as the container of the return value. When *epoll_wait* returns, the return value is set to be the number of active events, which are also stored in the first few elements of the *epoll_event* array. 
    
    **Level-triggered and edge-triggered**: When used as a level-triggered interface (the default, when EPOLLET is not specified), epoll is simply a faster poll(2), and can be used wherever the latter is used since it shares the same semantics. An application that employs the EPOLLET flag should use nonblocking file descriptors to avoid having a blocking read or write starve a task that is handling multiple file descriptors.  The suggested way to use epoll as an edge-triggered (EPOLLET) interface is as follows: (i) with nonblocking file descriptors; (ii)  by waiting for an event only after read(2) or write(2) return EAGAIN.

    **For the example above**: While the usage of epoll when employed as a level-triggered interface does have the same semantics as poll(2), the edge-triggered usage requires more clarification to avoid stalls in the application event loop.  In this example, listener is a nonblocking socket on which listen(2) has been called.  The function do_use_fd() uses the new ready file descriptor until EAGAIN is returned by either read(2) or write(2).  An event-driven state machine application should, after having received EAGAIN, record its current state so that at the next call to do_use_fd() it will continue to read(2) or write(2) from where it stopped before.

    **Struct epoll_event** is defined as:
    ```C
    typedef union epoll_data {
        void    *ptr;
        int      fd;
        uint32_t u32;
        uint64_t u64;
    } epoll_data_t;

    struct epoll_event {
        uint32_t     events;    /* Epoll events */
        epoll_data_t data;      /* User data variable */
    };
    ```
